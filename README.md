A physics-based AI simulation where spherical agents learn to autonomously navigate and reach targets through Reinforcement Learning (PPO). Built with Unity 6.3 LTS, ML-Agents 4.0.2, and Sentis 2.5.0, this project demonstrates the complete workflow from deep learning training to real-time autonomous inference. Pretrained onnx and python reqs included.
